                        <div class="descr">In 1951, a British statistician named Edward H. Simpson discovered a statistical phenomenon, which thereafter became known as Simpson’s Paradox. Other statisticians had mentioned similar effects earlier but Simpson was the first to truly describe this phenomenon in a technical paper. This paradox is used in statistics to illustrate the care that statisticians need to take when interpreting data because it can lead to false conclusions. Indeed, many statisticians believe that the mainstream public should be aware of the counter-intuitive results frequently found in statistics since statistics can shape public opinion. One of the best-known examples of Simpson's paradox is a study of gender bias among graduate school admissions to University of California, Berkeley. </div>

                        <div class="descr">In 1973, the University of California-Berkeley was sued for gender discrimination in graduate school admissions. At the surface level it appeared to be discrimination against women because they accepted 44% of male applicants but only 35% of female applicants. But, was this really the case?</div>

                    <section class="step">
                        <div class="title">Acceptance Rate for Department A</div><br>
                        <div class="descr">When researchers looked into the data, they found that for department A, 62% of male applicants were accepted and 82% of female applicants were accepted. So for department A it seemed as if the admissions office favored female applicants.</div>

                    <section class="step">
                        <div class="title">Acceptance Rate for Department B</div><br>
                        <div class="descr">Data from department B showed similar results. The department accepted 63% of male applicants and 67% of female applicants. So maybe there wasn’t any gender discrimination after all. This is a textbook case of Simpson’s Paradox. </div>

                        <div class="title">What is Simpson’s Paradox?</div><br>
                        <div class='descr'>What Simpson realized was that if you analyze some data sets in one way—first breaking them down by let’s say two variables and getting a specific result—and then analyze the same data sets by breaking them down further with a third variable, the results switch direction.

In short, Simpson’s Paradox is a statistical phenomenon in which a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. And these results appear to be in direct contradiction to one another.</div>
